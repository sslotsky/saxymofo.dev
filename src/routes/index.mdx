# Sam Slotsky _(a.k.a. SaxyMofo)_

Greetings, earth creatures! ðŸ––

I'm a [saxophonist](https://www.instagram.com/saxymofo/) living in the twin
cities, but by day I appear cleverly disguised as an experienced software
engineer. I'm a full stack polyglot specializing in NodeJS & TypeScript, but on
most days I wish I could be writing OCaml instead. I love simplicity, code
quality, and great user experiences. My favorite language is jazz.

It may surprise you, but I like other things too. Examples include chess,
cycling, cooking, gardening, and experiencing the richness of life in its many
forms, well known or unexpected. I'm one of those walkable city zealots and an
advocate for social justice. Sometimes I play sax with
[Brass Solidatiry](https://www.instagram.com/brasssolidarity/) down at George
Floyd Square.
