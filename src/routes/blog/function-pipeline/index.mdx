title: Function Pipelines in TypeScript
description:
  In this post I'll show you a way to use TypeScript
  generics to define a function pipeline, where the output
  of each function is used as input to the next. To keep
  things grounded in more appealing terms, we'll use our
  pipeline to build a pizza.

It happens frequently in software: you have a multi-step
process that gets broken into many mini-processes. Each one
is operating on the same input object, with some
processesaugmenting the object in some way. Middleware
chains are a well known example, but for the sake of this
post, let's talk about something more people can relate to.
Of course I'm talking about pizza! 🍕

In a pizza kitchen, a raw pizza crust gets sent down the
line, where it eventually gets sauce, cheese, and toppings.
These changes have to be applied in a certain order before
being sent to the oven! If a pizza requires sauce, then it
can't be sent to the cheese station before that sauce is
applied. So how could we model something like this in
software? In this post, I'll leverage TypeScript's type
system to define and chain together sequential
mini-processes where the constraints are enforced and
satisfied by the inputs and outputs of our function
definitions.

## Example API Usage

Every pizza place decides for itself which order to do
things in. When the pizza arrives at a station, it's a
pretty big problem if it's missing items that should have
already been added. We _could_ define `sauce`, `cheese`, and
various toppings as optional fields on a pizza object, but
if I wanted to design an API to build this pizza, I'd prefer
to have those constraints reflected in my type definitions,
rather than have each mini-process operate on a generic
pizza object with a bunch of optional fields. Maybe
something like this?

```ts
const pizzaBuilder = pizzaBuilder(makeRawCrust(order));

pizzaBuilder
  .add((crust: RawCrust) => {
    return addSauce(order, crust);
  })
  .add((sauced: CrustWithSauce) => {
    return addCheese(order, sauced);
  })
  .add((cheesed: CrustWithSauceAndCheese) => {
    return addToppings(order, cheesed);
  })
  .cook();
```

Here we feed a `RawCrust` into a `pizzaBuilder`, and then
add onto it one mini-process at a time. Each call to `add`
takes a process function, but it's important to note that it
can't be just _any_ function! Here are the type constraints:

1. The input to the first processor must be the same type
   that was passed to the builder (in this case, `RawCrust`)
1. The input to any other processor must by the same type as
   the output of the previous processor
1. The `cook()` function returns the finished product

## Implementation

There's two problems to solve:

1. Implement the API constraints with TypeScript types
1. Execute the processors

The first is far more interesting so we'll start there.
We'll also assume that what we're buiding might be useful
for more than just cooking great pizza, so we'll make the
names and initial inputs a bit more generic.

### Enforcing the type chain

For starters, we define a workflow generator that requires
some initial input. We'll also define the concept of a
processor function that takes a generic input and output.

```ts
type Processor<Input, Output> = (input: Input) => Output;
function workflow<InitialInput>(input: InitialInput) {}
```

Now let's generalize the problem of how to chain the
functions together. In TypeScript, there is no way to
declare a sequence of functions where the output of `F[n]`
is the same type as the input of `F[n + 1]`. So instead
we'll define three generic types: `Input`, `Output`, and
`NextInput`. These types will allow us to define a function
that can dynamically build upon itself each time it's used.

```ts
function process<Input, Output>(
  processor: Processor<Input, Output>
) {
  function next<NextInput>(
    nextProcessor: Processor<Output, NextInput>
  ) {
    return process(nextProcessor);
  }

  return next;
}
```

Note that this doesn't execute our processors yet. It only
allows us to chain the definitions together, like this:

```ts
process((initialInput: {}): { thing: number } => {
  return { thing: 42 };
})((input): { stringyThing: string } => {
  return { stringyThing: input.thing.toString() };
});
```

In this example we have two processes that modify what
started as a blank object. We're almost where we want to be
with this API already, we just need to make it look a bit
more like the pizza example and make sure that the input
type for the first processor matches our initial input.

```ts
function workflow<InitialInput>(input: InitialInput) {
  function process<Input, Output>(
    processor: Processor<Input, Output>
  ) {
    function next<NextInput>(
      nextProcessor: Processor<Output, NextInput>
    ) {
      return process(nextProcessor);
    }

    return { process: next };
  }

  function first<Output>(
    processor: Processor<InitialInput, Output>
  ) {
    return process(processor);
  }

  return { process: first };
}

workflow({})
  .process((input) => {
    return { ...input, thing: 42 };
  })
  .process((input) => {
    return {
      ...input,
      stringyThing: `the meaning of life is ${input.thing}`,
    };
  })
  .process((input) => {
    return {
      ...input,
      againButLouder: input.stringyThing.toUpperCase(),
    };
  });
```

This accomplishes the type chaining. All that remains is to
build in a way to execute these processors in sequence.

### Executing the chain

Again, let's generalize the problem. We have a sequence of
functions where the output from `F[n - 1]` becomes input to
`F[n]`. So for any function in the sequence, we can think of
all the previous functions as a single function. In other
words, if a given step has a processor, its build step might
look like this:

```ts {2,6}
function step<Input, Output>(
  buildPrevious: () => Input,
  processor: Processor<Input, Output>
) {
  function build(): Output {
    return processor(buildPrevious());
  }

  return { build };
}
```

In the example above, `buildPrevious()` executes all the
previous processors. If we copy the type chaining that we
saw earlier into the `step` abstraction above, the solution
starts to take shape:

```ts
function step<Input, Output>(
  buildPrevious: () => Input,
  processor: Processor<Input, Output>
) {
  function build(): Output {
    return processor(buildPrevious());
  }

  function process<NextOutput>(
    nextProcessor: Processor<Output, NextOutput>
  ) {
    return step(build, nextProcessor);
  }

  return { build, process };
}
```

So now if I have a `step`, I can call
`step.process(someProcessor)` to generate the next step in
the chain, and `step.build()` becomes the `buildPrevious()`
function for the `nextStep`. We now have a recursively
executing chain of processors that only needs a seed: 🌱

```ts
function workflow<InitialInput>(input: InitialInput) {
  function process<FirstOutput>(
    processor: Processor<InitialInput, FirstOutput>
  ) {
    return step(() => input, processor);
  }

  return { process };
}
```

You can try a working example of this at the
[TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBACgTgewMYQM6oXAPASQHZgCuwANFAPLFHAB8UAvFABQCWBxAXFPtQJQN1KwagG4AUGIBmhPEmAsEeKKmAQwudqQpViNJmKhQARoRYAbACbwIANwWFUXJv3p0exEgahhEKdJi54ZDQMbHctIWoaMX4Aby9pWXlFY1NLZy5I4ih4w0M4CGBCOCUfYP84JhNzKwK7BAdnXnFDAF8JQ0S5BVLfEKwAOQgAD2As2iY8EeAgv1DAvoqscbIh0fGaOK98wuKlFTUqtIsyKdHZkMxmr3avAqKSnNSasjK5qFbxW67kpQB3TAAa0kZgQfw0LHkAEMzOE9GxqFx8JCWDDwltOjJuik3v0AGIsOAqDb6PLeRbzWAUzAQ6GwzRkAlEsY6WheDF5e57ZSqMBMZwCKAIjzk8qha5tDpQLmPWKi96fMS3JCKFRQBrCbKMAFwYGgv5MWKtXheAB0uPQ-OFwBcdFynN2sqgppd1rIwAAFmwAOZcAAsACYPi0PibDOaKVbNLacttpY6lHKXaa3Ty4D6QAAVL14X1QAAGnugAFsIFC8D71ZIoGYWJJoCxUFAACSxa2mz0+1r54M3MPOi2oKN8QX2nYPRPO10MqBQ71QtgAIWIABkGhYIHAuO2VOnc1mc96OwgAKpgSBwADCUNQEAFira-dN1XS1zEKrwGDMEFNoO9TA1PgRCAA)
🚀 I encourage you to play around with the type definitions
going in and out of your processor functions as you imagine
any realistic, contrived, or completely ridiculous scenarios
that it could apply to.

## Conclusion

This post used a simplified example to demonstrate how
TypeScript can be leveraged to build a strongly typed
function pipeline where the output of each function is used
as the input to the next. There are probably a dozen ways
that it could be made more practical, including accounting
for async functions and increasing robustness with some form
of resumability or other error recovery. It's also worth
noting that a pipeline like this requires all processors to
operate on a single input, which is hard to work around
given the fact that a function can only return a single
output.

And of course, we'll probably never use this to build a
delicious pizza. But I do think that a scheme like this
could make a useful API for middleware chaining or other
commonly used abstractions like workflow processors and step
functions. The [zod validation library](https://zod.dev/)
has some similar features in its validation chaining API,
where the output of the validation callback is the return
type of the validation function. Perhaps by no surprise, it
was also an inspiration for this post.

I hope you will find this technique useful for a problem
that you need to solve, or that you perhaps learned a new
trick with TypeScript generics. In any case, thanks for
reading!
